# Face-Recognition-using-KNN

Here we make use of the  Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers for detecting face and eyes of a person.It then uses the KNN alogrithm to classify the faces of people.

Firstly the data about the face and eyes of a person is taken from the Face_data program and is stored as a numpy file which asks for the name of the user.

Then the Face_Recognition_code identifies the face of that person and displays their name.
